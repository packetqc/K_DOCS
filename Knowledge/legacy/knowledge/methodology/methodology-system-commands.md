## Multipart Help Architecture

The `help` command outputs a **concatenated** command table from two sources:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│  Part 1: Knowledge Commands       │  ← from packetqc/knowledge (this repo)
│  (session + live analysis)        │     Always present in every project
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│  Part 2: Project Commands         │  ← from <project>/CLAUDE.md
│  (project-specific)               │     Varies per project
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rule**: Any repo that reads `packetqc/knowledge` inherits Part 1 automatically. Part 2 is defined by each project independently. Commands are never duplicated — they are concatenated.

---

### End of Interactive Session (v2.0)

| Command | What Claude Does |
|---------|-----------------|
| `terminé` / `done` | Exit interactive mode — return to the knowledge-validation reference framework |

**Context-aware execution rules (v2.0):**

1. **Context analysis before execution** — Before executing any user command, analyze the current context window to determine what is already loaded and what the command requires.
2. **No redundant methodology reads** — If a methodology file has already been read in the current interval (before compaction), do not re-read it. Use the in-context version.
3. **Avoid compaction-triggering reads before execution** — Do not load large methodology files if doing so would trigger a context compaction right before execution. Execute with what is already available; defer additional reads to after the command completes.

## Live Session — Full Details

### `I'm live` flow
1. `git pull origin <branch> --rebase`
2. Extract last frame from `clip_2` (highest number = newest): `ffmpeg -i clip_2.mp4 -vf "select=eq(n\,59)" -vsync vfr -update 1 /tmp/latest_frame.png -y`
3. Report: active tab, entry range, page number, log count, button states, anomalies
4. On follow-up, pull and extract again

### `deep` flow
1. Pull latest clips
2. Extract ALL frames from newest clip: `ffmpeg -i clip_2.mp4 /tmp/deep_frame_%04d.png -y`
3. Frame-by-frame analysis focused on the described anomaly
4. Report: before state → anomaly frames → after state → root cause hypothesis → suggested investigation

### `analyze` flow
1. Extract key frames at regular intervals: `ffmpeg -i <path> -vf "fps=1" /tmp/static_frame_%04d.png -y`
2. For short videos (< 30s), extract every second. For longer videos, sample every 5–10s.
3. Build state progression timeline with anomaly detection
4. Report: timeline summary, state transitions, anomalies, test verdict (pass/fail)

### `multi-live` flow
1. Scan `live/dynamic/` for all clip families
2. Extract last frame from each family's highest-numbered file
3. Report comparative state in a single table
4. Flag cross-source inconsistencies immediately

### `recipe` output
```
Live Capture — Quick Recipe

1. Windows: Start OBS → Tools → RTSP Server → Start (port 8554, path /live)
2. WSL:
   cd /path/to/project
   python3 live/stream_capture.py --dynamic --rtsp rtsp://localhost:8554/live --scale 0.75 --crf 22 --push-interval 5
3. Claude: "I'm live" — starts monitoring clips
4. Stop: Ctrl+C in WSL (clips persist for montage, cleaned at next start)

Presets:
  QA session (recommended):  --scale 0.75 --crf 22 --push-interval 5
  UART text (sharp):         --scale 1.0  --crf 22 --clip-secs 3
  High quality debug:        --scale 1.0  --crf 18 --fps 30
  Save bandwidth:            --fps 10     --clip-secs 5 --crf 32
```

### Clip naming convention
```
live/dynamic/
  clip_0.mp4, clip_1.mp4, clip_2.mp4       # Primary: UI
  uart_0.mp4, uart_1.mp4, uart_2.mp4       # Secondary: Serial terminal
  cam_0.mp4,  cam_1.mp4,  cam_2.mp4        # Tertiary: Physical board camera
```

### Live Session Directives
1. No image prints — extract data silently via ffmpeg probes or single-frame reads
2. Start from latest clip (clip_2 → clip_1 → clip_0)
3. Fast 1-frame pulls — last frame of latest clip only
4. Focus on live troubleshooting — no queued tasks during live sessions
5. Proceed with live code modifications based on UART feedback
6. No waiting — report what's visible, propose fixes immediately

### Escalation from live to deep
During a standard `I'm live` session, Claude may **proactively suggest** hybrid analysis when it detects:
- State inconsistency between consecutive pulls
- UI elements in unexpected positions or states
- Data values that don't match expected progression
- Artifacts or rendering glitches in extracted frames

Claude will say: *"Spotted [anomaly] — want me to go deep on this?"*

## Visuals — Full Details

### `visual` command

The Visual Documentation Engine processes video files using OpenCV + Pillow + NumPy (no external tools, no cloud APIs).

### Two operating modes

**Timestamp mode** — extract frames at known points:
```bash
# By seconds offset
visual recording.mp4 --timestamps 10.5 30.0 60.0

# By clock time (with optional video start for offset calc)
visual recording.mp4 --times 00:01:30 00:05:00 --video-start 00:00:00

# By date-time
visual recording.mp4 --dates "2026-03-01 14:30:00" --video-start-datetime "2026-03-01 14:00:00"
```

**Detection mode** — automatic frame extraction using computer vision:
```bash
# Default detection (scene change + text + edges + structure)
visual recording.mp4 --detect

# With subject hints and tuned sensitivity
visual recording.mp4 --detect --subjects "UART" "error" --sensitivity 0.25 --max-frames 30

# From GitHub repo
visual --repo packetqc/stm32-poc --file live/dynamic/clip_0.mp4 --detect
```

### Detection heuristics

| Detector | What it finds | Method |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Scene change | Visual transitions | Histogram correlation |
| Text density | Text-heavy frames | Adaptive threshold + morphology |
| Edge density | Diagrams, tables, code | Canny edge detection |
| Structured content | Grids, forms | Horizontal + vertical line detection |

### Output pipeline

```bash
# Full pipeline: detect + dedup + markdown report + contact sheet
visual recording.mp4 --detect --dedup --report --sheet --title "Sprint Demo Evidence"

# Info only (no extraction)
visual recording.mp4 --info

# JSON output (for programmatic use)
visual recording.mp4 --detect --json
```

### Frame annotation

Extracted frames include optional annotation overlay:
- Timestamp bar (bottom, semi-transparent)
- Source info (filename, resolution)
- Detection badge (green, detection reason)
- Corner marks (green evidence indicators)

Disable with `--no-annotate`.

### `deep` and `analyze` (recording analysis)

These commands originated in Live Session and are now part of the Visuals category:

- `deep <description>`: Frame-by-frame analysis focused on a described anomaly. Extracts ALL frames from the newest clip and builds a before→anomaly→after timeline.
- `analyze <path>`: Static video file analysis. Extracts key frames at regular intervals, builds state progression timeline with anomaly detection.

### Full specification

- `methodology/methodology-documentation-visual.md` — Architecture, modes, output pipeline
- `scripts/visual_engine.py` — Core processing engine (970 lines)
- `scripts/visual_cli.py` — CLI entry point (argparse dispatcher)
- Publication #22 — Visual Documentation

---

## Part 2 — Project Commands (Examples)

These are defined in each project's own CLAUDE.md. They form the second part of multipart help.

### MPLIB Projects

| Command | What Claude Does |
|---------|-----------------|
| `vanilla <NAME> <LED>` | Generate singleton module from VANILLA template |

**Example**: `vanilla GPS YELLOW`

Creates `MPLIB_GPS.h` and `MPLIB_GPS.cpp` from the template with:
- All naming replacements (class, guards, scope operators, static guard, pointer)
- LED color assignment
- Unique ThreadX entry point (`Services_GPS()`)

**Available LED colors**: `GREEN` | `BLUE` | `YELLOW` | `ORANGE` | `RED` | `CYAN` | `PURPLE`

---

## Knowledge Asset Sync

On `wakeup`, Claude syncs portable assets from `knowledge` to the active project:

| Asset | Knowledge path | Project path | Sync condition |
|-------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Capture engine | `live/stream_capture.py` | `<project>/live/stream_capture.py` | If `live/` folder missing |
| Knowledge beacon | `live/knowledge_beacon.py` | `<project>/live/knowledge_beacon.py` | If `live/` folder missing |
| Knowledge scanner | `live/knowledge_scanner.py` | `<project>/live/knowledge_scanner.py` | If `live/` folder missing |
| Folder scaffold | `live/dynamic/.gitkeep`, `live/static/.gitkeep` | `<project>/live/dynamic/`, `<project>/live/static/` | If `live/` folder missing |
| Live README | `live/README.md` | `<project>/live/README.md` | If `live/` folder missing |
| PQC envelope | `scripts/pqc_envelope.py` | `<project>/scripts/pqc_envelope.py` | If missing individually |
| GitHub helper | `scripts/gh_helper.py` | `<project>/scripts/gh_helper.py` | If missing individually |
| Roadmap sync | `scripts/sync_roadmap.py` | `<project>/scripts/sync_roadmap.py` | If missing individually |
| Visual engine | `scripts/visual_engine.py` | `<project>/scripts/visual_engine.py` | If missing individually |
| Visual CLI | `scripts/visual_cli.py` | `<project>/scripts/visual_cli.py` | If missing individually |

**Rule**: Only sync if the project doesn't already have the asset. Never overwrite existing project files (they may be customized). Only tooling is synced — clips (`.mp4`) are never part of knowledge.

---

## Command Registry & Skill Backing (v100)

Every command listed in Part 1 is backed by a **Claude Code skill** (`.claude/skills/<name>.md`) and registered in the `COMMAND_REGISTRY` dictionary in `scripts/session_agent/task_workflow.py`.

### COMMAND_REGISTRY Structure

The registry maps 42 command patterns to their skill, methodology, label, group, and optional methodology family:

```python
COMMAND_REGISTRY = {
    "project create": {
        "skill": "project-create",
        "label": "FEATURE",
        "methodology": "methodology-project-create.md",
        "description": "Create new project with P# registration",
        "group": "project"
    },
    "pub new": {
        "skill": "/pub",
        "label": "FEATURE",
        "methodology": "methodology-documentation.md",
        "methodology_family": "methodology-documentation",  # ← work command: auto-loads family
        "description": "Scaffold new publication",
        "group": "content"
    },
    "pub list": {
        "skill": "/pub",
        "label": "REVIEW",
        "methodology": "methodology-documentation.md",
        # ← no methodology_family: management command, primary only
        "description": "List all publications with status",
        "group": "content"
    },
    # ... 39 more entries
}
```

**Longest-match-first**: When matching user input, the registry is sorted by key length descending. This ensures `harvest --healthcheck` matches before `harvest`, and `normalize --fix` matches before `normalize`.

### Methodology Family Auto-Loading

The `methodology_family` field enables **automatic discovery** of all related methodology files. When a command is detected, `resolve_methodologies()` scans `methodology/` for files matching the family prefix and returns them all.

**Management vs Work distinction**: Only commands that do real work (create, sync, export, review, fix) declare a `methodology_family`. Management commands (list, check, --check) load only their primary methodology — they don't need the full specialization context.

**How it works:**

```
Work command: "pub new mon-article"
  → detect_command() matches "pub new"
  → methodology_family: "methodology-documentation"
  → resolve_methodologies() → 9 files:
      "methodology-documentation.md",             # primary
      "methodology-documentation-audience.md",     # family
      "methodology-documentation-engineering.md",
      "methodology-documentation-generation.md",
      "methodology-documentation-visual.md",
      "methodology-documentation-web.md",
      "methodology-working-style.md",              # working-style standard
      "methodology-task-workflow.md",              # working-style standard
      "methodology-engineer.md"                    # working-style standard
  → Claude reads ALL files → fully specialized for the task

Management command: "pub list"
  → detect_command() matches "pub list"
  → no methodology_family
  → resolve_methodologies() → 1 file:
      "methodology-documentation.md"               # primary only
  → Quick listing, no specialization needed
```

**Working-style standards** (`WORKING_STYLE_STANDARDS`): For families `methodology-documentation` and `methodology-interactive`, three foundational method-of-work files are automatically appended:
1. `methodology-working-style.md` — User collaboration patterns and expectations
2. `methodology-task-workflow.md` — 8-stage task lifecycle
3. `methodology-engineer.md` — Engineering practices

**File naming convention drives the intelligence:**
- Files named `methodology-documentation-*.md` → documentation family
- Files named `methodology-interactive-*.md` → interactive family
- Adding a new file `methodology-documentation-api.md` → automatically included in all documentation work commands

### Skill-to-Command Mapping

| Group | Commands | Type | Primary Methodology | Family |
|-------|----------|------|--------------------| -------|
| **Session** | wakeup, refresh, resume, recover, recall, checkpoint | mgmt | session-protocol.md | — |
| **Harvest** | harvest, harvest --list/--fix/--healthcheck/--review/--stage/--promote/--auto/--procedure | mgmt | methodology-staging.md | — |
| **Content** | pub list, pub check, docs check | mgmt | methodology-documentation.md | — |
| **Content** | pub new, pub sync, doc review | **work** | methodology-documentation.md | `methodology-documentation` |
| **Content** | pub export | **work** | methodology-system-web-export.md | `methodology-documentation` |
| **Webcard** | webcard | **work** | methodology-documentation-web.md | `methodology-documentation` |
| **Webcard** | weblinks, weblinks --admin | mgmt | methodology-documentation-web.md | — |
| **Profile** | profile update | mgmt | methodology-profile-update.md | — |
| **Project** | project list/info/create/register/review | mgmt | methodology-project-management.md | — |
| **Normalize** | normalize, normalize --fix | **work** | methodology-interactive-work-sessions.md | `methodology-interactive` |
| **Normalize** | normalize --check | mgmt | methodology-interactive-work-sessions.md | — |
| **Tagged Input** | #N:, g:board:item | mgmt | methodology-tagged-input.md | — |
| **Live** | I'm live, multi-live | **work** | methodology-interactive-diagnostic.md | `methodology-interactive` |
| **Live** | recipe | mgmt | methodology-interactive-diagnostic.md | — |
| **Visual** | visual, deep, analyze | **work** | methodology-documentation-visual.md | `methodology-documentation` |

### Sub-Task Execution

When a command is detected during the task workflow, it executes as a **tracked sub-task** within the parent task. The sub-task records its own status, commits, and files_modified in `session_data.sub_tasks[]`. The `methodologies` list (resolved from family) is available on the sub-task for Claude to read before execution. See `methodology/methodology-task-workflow.md` § "Command Detection & Sub-Task Lifecycle (v100)".

## Implementation Notes for New Projects

When setting up a new project:
1. Always implement all Part 1 commands (`wakeup`, `help`, `status`, `save`, `<remember>`, all live commands)
2. `help` always outputs multipart: knowledge commands first, then project commands
3. `wakeup` syncs `live/` tooling from knowledge if missing
4. Add Part 2 project-specific commands in the project's own CLAUDE.md
5. Knowledge is the single source of truth for Part 1 — project CLAUDE.md never redefines them
