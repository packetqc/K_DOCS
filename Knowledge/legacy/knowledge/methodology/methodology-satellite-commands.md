# Satellite Commands Template
<!-- template-version: v54 -->

This file is the **canonical source** for the commands section of satellite CLAUDE.md files.
On wakeup, if a satellite detects version drift, it reads this file and injects the commands
section into its own CLAUDE.md — replacing the old commands section and updating the version tag.

**How it works**: The content between `<!-- BEGIN COMMANDS -->` and `<!-- END COMMANDS -->` markers
is extracted and injected into the satellite's CLAUDE.md between `## Commands (from Knowledge)`
and the next `---` separator. The version tag is updated to match `template-version` above.

**When to update this file**: Every time a command is added, removed, or renamed in core CLAUDE.md.
Keep this file in sync with the commands reference in `methodology/methodology-satellite-bootstrap.md`.

<!-- BEGIN COMMANDS -->
## Commands (from Knowledge)

Full command details and implementation come from core on wakeup (Step 0).
The `help` command outputs these 8 groups with publication links.

### Critical Behavioral Rules

- **`gh_helper.py` is the ONLY working API method** — `gh` CLI is NOT installed in Claude Code containers. `curl` to `api.github.com` is blocked by the proxy (strips auth headers, returns 401). Only Python `urllib` (used by `scripts/gh_helper.py`) bypasses the proxy. For ALL GitHub API operations (PR create, merge, branch ops): use `gh_helper.py` with `GH_TOKEN` env var.
- **Plan mode wakeup** — When session starts in plan mode, Bash/Edit/Write are blocked. Auto-wakeup MUST still run using read-only tools: WebFetch for Step 0 (sunglasses), Read for notes/CLAUDE.md, text output for help. Skip write steps (bootstrap, self-heal, asset sync). Run deferred write steps after plan approval. Without this adaptation, the satellite gets no sunglasses and behaves like an NPC.
- **Interactive Input Convention** — Commands requiring multiple parameters (like `project create`) MUST gather ALL inputs upfront via a single `AskUserQuestion` popup BEFORE any execution. Gather first, execute second. If the user provided a parameter on the command line (e.g., `project create "My Project"`), pre-fill it and skip that question.
- **3 project types** — `core`, `child`, `managed`. Every project links to a repo. Child → own repo. Managed → host repo (or core repo as fallback). No project exists without a repo link.
- **Auto-elevate** — Commands needing a token (`project create`, `harvest --fix`, etc.) check elevation state first. If not elevated, auto-trigger the elevation popup. User never needs to type `elevate` separately.
- **Auto-save** — Commands that produce files include delivery (commit → push → PR → merge/report) as their final step. User never needs to type `save` after a command that changed files.
